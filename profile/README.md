## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

PerfectProject is my engineering project that leverages AWS cloud, Python, and Node.js environment. 
The application architecture is based on microservices that can be deployed independently, which 
simplifies development and enhances code readability. The entire application can be easily and quickly 
deployed in various regions worldwide. This project emphasizes the simplest possible way of application 
deployment and security. Deployment relies on the serverless framework technology, which straightforwardly 
enables the creation of stacks in the AWS CloudFormation service. The frontend of the application 
is developed in Angular. Authentication is based on AWS Cognito, and the backend is powered by Flask.
